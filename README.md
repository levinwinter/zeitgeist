### Naming Convention

A **subject** represents a course or class.
The student can either chose it as **major** or **minor**.
Multiple subjects get grouped in **fields**, which again can be condensed into **categories**.

One pair of majors and minors (subjects) is called a **choice**.
It is always made by the student.
Whereas an **option** describes two sets of fields or arrays of fields in which the subjects have to lie.
A **combination** is (as the name might suggest) a special combination of the available subjects defined by the fields of the option.
